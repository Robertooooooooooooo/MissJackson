# MissJackson
# Climbing out the back door, didn't leave a mark. No one knows it's you, Miss Jackson. Found another victim. But no one's gonna find. Miss Jackson 
You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now
You move in circles, hoping no one's gonna find out
But we're so lucky
Kiss the ring and let them bow down
Looking for the time of your life
A pretty picture, but the scenery is so loud
A face like Heaven, catching lightning in your nightgown
But back away from the water, babe, you might drown
The party isn't over tonight 
Hey, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway
I love her anyway, I love her anyway
Out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Are you nasty? I love her anyway
Oh, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway
